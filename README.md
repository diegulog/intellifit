# IntelliFit

Android application to guide users in the correct execution of physical exercises using artificial intelligence and motion detection techniques to analyze and provide real-time feedback on posture and exercise execution.

The application architecture is based on the Android MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, which allows separating the logic from the view and facilitates the creation of scalable and maintainable applications.
